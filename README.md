I'm just going to follows this format as if I can't make my own.
- 👋 Hi, I’m @boonrm
- 👀 I’m interested in math and astronomy, especially astrophysics. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning [practicing] for the AMC 12 and possibly AIME. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing...?????? 
- 📫 How to reach me?! I'm flattered you would want to reach out to me. How about my email, patiw0707@gmail.com?
